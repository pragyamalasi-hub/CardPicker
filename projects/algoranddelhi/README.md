# Notes Smart Contract

A simple Algorand smart contract built using **Algorand TypeScript SDK**. This project demonstrates how to create and manage a basic **to-do list** on-chain, where notes can be stored and retrieved in a decentralized manner.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project serves as a **beginner-friendly example** of writing Algorand smart contracts in TypeScript. It provides a straightforward way to store notes (title + description) in Algorand’s **Global State**, making it a great starting point for anyone learning **Algorand + smart contract development**.

---

## 🚀 What it does

* Stores notes on Algorand blockchain.
* Each note is added with a `title` and a `description`.
* Data is persisted on-chain using the **GlobalState**.
* Easy to extend for building decentralized apps (dApps).

---

## ✨ Features

* 📄 **Add Notes** → Save a note with title and description.
* 🔒 **Immutable Storage** → Stored securely on-chain.
* 🛠️ **Beginner Friendly** → Clean, simple contract structure.
* ⚡ **TypeScript SDK** → Easy to write and maintain.

export class Notes extends Contract {
 todolist = GlobalState<string>({
    key: "Notelist",
    initialValue : " "
 })

 Addtodo(title:string, description:string):string {
    this.todolist.value = title + "" +  description;
    return title;
 }
}
```
